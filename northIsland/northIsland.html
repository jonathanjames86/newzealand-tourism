        You're a legend mate'. Head north of Auckland making sure to stop in Whangarei, hire a boat for some snorkeling
        out to Poor Knights Island marine. If you're more of a DIY-er just 8 miles west of Wellsford lies
        Goat Island reserve. Continue up north to SW-11 which takes you straight to the Bay of Islands.
